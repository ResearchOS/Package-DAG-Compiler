# Publishing Packages

You've created a set of TOML files, you've compiled them to a DAG, maybe you've even bridged your package with others to create something even more powerful, and you're ready to share your package with the world. 

There are multiple ways to share your package with the world.

# 1. PyPI
The Python Packaging Authority maintains the Python Packaging Index (PyPI), which is where the majority of Python packages reside. Packages in PyPI can be easily installed using `pip install`.

# 2. GitHub (or Other Online Version Control)
If your package is publicly visible and hosted in an online version control platform such as GitHub or another service, you can simply leave it there! Others can pip install directly from your GitHub repository.
